# Day 9

## Part 1

This part was easy, done in about 45 minutes.

Approach:

Build dictionary with psotions and directions from there
Lookup next position until ZZZ is reached

## Part 2

Part is a beast.

With the same approach as part1 i ran into a performance problem.

At first attempt after about 10 billion (10.000.000.000.000) tries and about 12 hour i cancelled.

not sure if there is some fault, or is it only poor performance of python.

still single threaded, dont know how to split that up for multiple cores.

*still trying*
