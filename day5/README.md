# thats a beast

made following failure in progression

First i treated it like a dabase admin would do
fill in all data in some structure to answer every possible question
afterward - ok for example data, but out-of-memory with the real input.

Second is concetraded in example data too long, the real data is huge.

Part2 is not working, could be possible correct but too slow.
This code needs some optimization.
