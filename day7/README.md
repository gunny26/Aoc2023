# Day 7 Camel Cards

that was a hard one, not easy to understand.

## Part 1

my approach

   * building functions to detect five-of-a-kind, full-house, etc.
   * transform hand in some sortable charaters (tried also numerical values, but that worked out not so well)
   * building sortable ranking string for every hand

## Part 2

*still trying*
