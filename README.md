# Advent of Code 2023

Some challenges in python. Ever day is made from scratch n previous help.
Sourcecode is not optimized after the correct answer is found,
there are also some not not necessary parts sometime left.
These are leftover from progression to get the code working.

I try to get challenge 1 and challenge 2.
